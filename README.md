# A sample starter project

This is a starter project based on the [near-misses.netlify.com](https://near-misses.netlify.com/) MDN tool chain demo web site.

It uses the following technology (which of course you are welcome to change):

- [dev][eslint](https://eslint.org/)
- [dev][prettier](https://prettier.io/)
- [build][parcel](https://parceljs.org/)
- [build][postcss stage-0](https://github.com/csstools/postcss-preset-env)
- [eng][react](https://reactjs.org/)

To run locally use the following commands in the working directory:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev # start the local server
```

The first run will take about 60 seconds, but subsequent runs will around 2-3 seconds.

Once you're ready to release your project, run `npm run build` and upload the `dist` directory to your hosting platform - or [connect your git repository](https://www.netlify.com/) to Netlify for free hosting.

There are many other [starter-kits](https://github.com/topics/starter-kit) or [zero-config](https://github.com/topics/zero-configuration) projects available too.
